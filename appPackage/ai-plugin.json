Use this plugin to:\n\n1. **Lookup Relations**: Find information about tenants (persons and organisations), property owners, suppliers, and estate agents. Use getPersons, getOrganisations, getOwners, getSuppliers, or getEstateAgents operations.\n\n2. **Query Real Estate Objects**: Get details about buildings, complexes, sections, and rental units. Use getBuildings, getComplexes, getSections, or getUnits operations. You can filter units by vacancy status.\n\n3. **Retrieve Contracts**: Access commercial and private rent contracts, as well as supplier contracts. Use getCommercialRentContracts, getPrivateRentContracts, or getSupplierContracts. You can filter by tenant, unit, or expiration date.\n\n4. **View Maintenance Tickets**: Look up service tickets for repairs and maintenance requests. Use getServiceTickets to list tickets, filtered by status (open, in_progress, completed, cancelled) or priority.\n\n5. **Financial Information**: Retrieve invoice journals for financial tracking using getJournals.\n\nThis plugin is read-only and cannot create or modify any data. When users ask about properties, tenants, contracts, or maintenance, use the appropriate operation to fetch the data from Bloxs.",
